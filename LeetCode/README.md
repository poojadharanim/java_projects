# LeetCode Solutions (Java)

This folder contains my Java solutions to LeetCode problems.
At this stage, I am solving problems across different topics
to strengthen my overall problem-solving skills and logic building.

The focus is on:
- Understanding problem statements clearly
- Writing clean and readable Java code
- Learning patterns such as stack usage, recursion, and basic backtracking

Problems are added as I practice and may not follow a strict
topic-wise or difficulty-wise order yet.

This repository will gradually evolve into a more structured
collection as I gain more experience.
